# html5-clock
A millisecond truncated html only clock. I don't like flash

Dead simple clock that displays milliseconds. Uses your browser's locale to format the time.

I have no idea on how acurate this clock is please don't use it for time critical environments.

style in obs using css: 
```
#clock { color:white; font-size:3em;}

```
